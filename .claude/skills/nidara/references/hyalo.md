# Hyalo — the compositor of our own

Hyalo (`hyalo/`) is Nidara's Wayland compositor, on Smithay (Rust). The decision and the plan
are issue #680 (five blocks, #681–#685); the measurements that led there, #679. **Until the
switch (#685) Hyprland is the session everybody gets**; Hyalo ships as a second session,
"Nidara — Hyalo preview", in its own package (`nidara-hyalo`), which nothing depends on and
`install.sh` does not install. Build and run instructions are in `hyalo/README.md` — this file
is the WHY and the traps.

## Where Hyalo's pieces are

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `hyalo/compositor/src/backend/tty.rs` | the session: DRM/KMS + GBM, libinput, libseat, udev hotplug, frames paced by vblank |
| `hyalo/compositor/src/backend/winit.rs` | a window in another compositor — development only |
| `hyalo/compositor/src/render/` | the scene as render elements, front to back; the glass (`glass.rs`, `glass_gl.rs`) |
| `hyalo/compositor/src/outputs.rs` | outputs as configured: arrange, apply, power, the windows' way home (#594) |
| `hyalo/compositor/src/config.rs` | the TOML layers and the watcher |
| `hyalo/compositor/src/ipc/` | the JSON socket and `nidara-hyalo msg` |
| `protocols/` | OUR protocols' XML, for both ends: Hyalo builds the server half, `lib/nidara-wl` the client half |
| `config/hyalo/hyalo.toml` | the shipped defaults, autostart included |
| `bin/nidara-hyalo-session`, `config/wayland-sessions/nidara-hyalo.desktop` | the preview session |
| `ui/shell/core/hyalo-ipc.ts`, `ui/shell/core/Displays.ts` | the shell's side (below) |

## Smithay is a library we never patch

Pinned by revision in `hyalo/Cargo.toml`, never forked or patched — Smithay's `AI.md`
discourages LLM-written contributions, so "we need a change in Smithay" is a dead end, not a
PR (#679's hard criterion). Everything Hyalo does goes through Smithay's public API. The way to
move the pin is in `hyalo/README.md`.

## The glass is a framebuffer effect, not an offscreen frame

`render/glass.rs` makes each surface's glass (`nidara-material-v1`) a render element of its
own, placed right below its surface, that declares `is_framebuffer_effect()`. Smithay's damage
tracker then calls `capture_framebuffer` when — and only when — something BEHIND the glass
changed, after redrawing everything behind it, and `draw` when the glass's own area is damaged.
So a bar over a still wallpaper re-blurs nothing per frame, and the rest of the frame keeps
damage tracking and direct scanout. The prototype drew every frame whole into a texture; do not
go back to that.

- **The shader works in OUTPUT pixels and borrows Smithay's projection** (`GlesFrame::projection()`),
  so every rotation or flip of an output is handled once, there. The captured copy is in
  framebuffer orientation; the blur is isotropic, so the pyramid does not care.
- **8-bit swapchains only** (`COLOR_FORMATS` in tty.rs): `glCopyTexSubImage2D` copies into an RGB
  texture, which any 8-bit framebuffer can feed and a 10-bit one cannot.
- GL objects that belong to a context live in the EGL context's user data; a glass's own pyramid
  lives in the damage tracker's per-element cache, and is deleted through a trash list on the next
  capture, because a cache is dropped where no context is current.

## Three config layers, and runtime changes over IPC

Read in order, merged table by table, last wins: `/usr/share/nidara/hyalo/hyalo.toml` (shipped),
`~/.config/nidara/hyalo-settings.toml` (written by Settings, never by hand),
`~/.config/nidara/hyalo.toml` (the user's own) — the order of `nidara-*.lua` then
`hyprland-user.lua`. The files are watched (an mtime poll, immune to editors that replace the
file); a broken file is refused and the running settings stay. An unknown key is an error, not
silently ignored (`deny_unknown_fields`).

Runtime changes go through the IPC socket, never by rewriting a file — the 09-12 freeze came
from Hyprland's config being rewritten twice in a second (`project_freeze_after_533_checkout`).
A setting changed over IPC is runtime only; persisting it is the shell's job (MonitorConfig
writes `hyalo-settings.toml`).

## The shell on Hyalo

The shell finds Hyalo by `$HYALO_SOCKET`, which `uwsm finalize HYALO_SOCKET` (Hyalo's first
autostart line) exports to the session's services. `core/hyalo-ipc.ts` speaks the socket the way
`core/hypr-ipc.ts` speaks Hyprland's: sync requests, one held event stream that reconnects and
says so. `core/Displays.ts` hands out the monitors in one shape from either compositor; the
Display page and `core/MonitorConfig.ts` read only that. **This is the pattern #682 extends to
the rest of the shell** (workspaces, windows, rules): a facade per concern, Hyprland behind one
side, Hyalo's IPC behind the other — not `if (hyalo)` sprinkled through surfaces.

What does not work yet on Hyalo is everything else behind `HyprlandState` (workspaces, window
list, `hyprctl` options): the shell logs it as CRITICALs and carries on. That is #682.

## Traps found running Hyalo for real

- **Autostart runs only with `--session`.** `uwsm finalize` from a development window would
  export the window's socket into the LIVE session's services. The session entry passes the flag;
  nothing else should.
- **An output that goes away: surfaces leave FIRST, the global goes after.** A client that sees
  the global removed destroys its `wl_output`; a `leave` naming it afterwards arrives as
  `leave(nil)`, which killed kitty outright. Layer surfaces on that output get `closed`, as
  wlr-layer-shell asks.
- **A mode list that changes is not a hotplug.** EDID arriving late, or a VM window resized,
  sends udev `Changed`: keep the output, update the list, re-set a mode only if the current one is
  gone. Rebuilding the output closed every surface on it — and the shell's bar came back with its
  clock stopped (a GLib source removed twice), a shell bug that rebuild exposed.
- **Software rendering is accepted for the primary GPU** (CI's vkms, a VM without 3D); after
  adding it, re-read the primary node, which may now be the card node. `HYALO_DRM_DEVICE` names the
  ONE GPU to use and then only it.
- **A refusal is said.** `vrr=on` on a monitor without VRR is an error, not a silent no-op.
- **The scan-out feedback is sticky** (`pick_feedback` in `backend/mod.rs`). Smithay's
  `select_dmabuf_feedback` follows the frame, and each switch is a new modifier set. Mesa's
  Wayland WSI answers that with `VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR`, and GTK rebuilds its swapchain on it, so the
  shell logs a `Gdk-WARNING … VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR` for each rebuild. It counted 55 in its first
  25 s on an amdgpu (2026-10-01), while the one free overlay plane passed between its
  monitor-sized layers. Once offered, the scan-out feedback stays. This is safe only while the
  scan-out tranche lists nothing we cannot render from (`surface_feedback` in tty.rs intersects
  it with the render formats). Drop that intersection and the sticky rule becomes a bug. Hyprland
  never shows this, because it uses no overlay planes. Its only direct scan-out is a fullscreen
  window.
- `xcursor`'s `pixels_rgba` is the file's byte order, i.e. DRM `Argb8888`, whatever its name says.
- A screenshot's read-back (`ExportMem::copy_framebuffer`): a mapping that is NOT `flipped()`
  holds the bottom row first.

## Testing Hyalo

- Never against the live session. `hyalo/scripts/headless-shot.sh` and `headless-shell.sh` run
  Hyalo in a window of a HEADLESS `cage` on the real GPU (the real shell sealed off by
  `sandboxed-shell.sh`), with `HYALO_CONTROL` for input and `nidara-hyalo msg screenshot` for
  pictures.
- The tty backend — the one that matters — is tested in the VM (maintainer harness), as a session
  from the greeter or from a VT; QEMU's `virtio-gpu,max_outputs=2` gives two outputs.
- On real hardware: `hyalo/scripts/install-preview.sh` installs the session on a dev install
  (the package cannot go there), and `measure-session.sh`, run once per session, gives the
  like-for-like numbers #681 asks for. Running Hyalo on the maintainer's own GPU is the owner's
  step: it needs sudo, and the first boot on new hardware is the one most likely to fail.
- CI's `hyalo` job (`scripts/ci/hyalo-smoke.sh`) builds with the lock file, clippy `-D warnings`,
  unit tests, then boots the tty backend on vkms with the real shell on it. NOT a required check
  while Hyalo is a preview: it must never hold the merge queue for the desktop that ships.
