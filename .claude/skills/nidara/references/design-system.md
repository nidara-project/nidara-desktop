# Nidara — Design system & SCSS conventions

Read this when editing any SCSS, adding a new visual component, changing tokens, or deciding whether to use Adwaita or pure GTK4 for a new surface.

## Nidara vocabulary

- Glass capsules; blur ~40px (SCSS preview) or real blur from Hyprland (production).
- 1px inner white border, soft outer shadow, top sheen.
- **Accent color is for active/selected state only.** Never for normal borders or normal buttons.
- **Accent is NEVER a text colour** — not even for the active/selected state. It doesn't contrast reliably on every background. Active/selected text reads in the mode-aware token (`--nidara-text`/`-secondary`/`-dim`, `#fff` dark / `#000` light); the accent conveys the state via **background fill, tinted background (`--nidara-accent-10`), or border** instead (e.g. active workspace number, calendar "today", selected segment, chips/badges, suggested alert button = bold not accent). The one exception is white text *on* an accent fill (`--nidara-accent-fg`). Symbolic **icons** may still tint to accent (not text).

## Radii (capsule-first)

- pill — `9999`
- lg — `24`
- md — `16`
- sm — `10`
- xs — `6`
- Squircle 28% (n ≈ 3.2) — **only** for app-icon plates.

## Tokens

Tokens live in `styles/_base.scss`. Dark/light values are injected at runtime by `NidaraTheme.ts → generateTokensCss()`. **Never invent hex values.** Use:

- `--nidara-accent`
- `--nidara-text*`
- `--nidara-surface*`
- `--nidara-border`
- `--nidara-radius-*`
- `--nidara-shadow-*`
- `--nidara-material-{thin,regular,thick,chrome}`
- `--nidara-danger`, `--nidara-success`, `--nidara-warning`

The only legitimate hex literals are the accent swatches and the danger/success/warning seeds defined inside `NidaraTheme.ts`.

## Shell-skin appearance & opacity (`appearance.shellAppearance` + the glass sliders)

### Appearance pin — the WHOLE shell skin, not just bar/dock

Text colour is mode-bound (`--nidara-text` = `#fff` dark / `#000` light) but shell glass is
translucent over the wallpaper. In dark mode white text forgives almost any wallpaper; in
**light mode black text fails on a dark wallpaper** when the glass is too transparent. The fix
is the appearance pin (NOT an opacity floor — see below).

**`appearance.shellAppearance`** (`system | dark | light`, default `system`) pins the **entire
shell skin** — bar, dock, AND every overlay (CC/NC/Prism/system menu/overview/app grid) — to
dark/light independent of the app/global mode, so the shell stays legible over any wallpaper
while apps follow their own mode. **App-mode windows are EXCLUDED**: Settings
(`nidara-settings-window`) and About (`nidara-about`) follow the system mode like any app. It
flips the **whole token family** (text AND surfaces/edges/shadows), never just `--nidara-text`.
`Theme.chromeIsDark` resolves it ("chrome" now means the whole shell skin).

How the flip works:
- **CSS side:** `NidaraTheme.generateChromeTokenScope()` re-emits the full `--nidara-*` block
  (factored into `nidaraVars()`) under a scoped selector when the shell differs from the system.
  - **Scope = `window#nidara-bar *, window#nidara-dock *`** (both windows + descendants). The
    bar window's `Gtk.Overlay` hosts ALL the overlays, so scoping the whole window covers them;
    Settings/About are separate toplevels, so they're excluded automatically.
  - **GOTCHA:** the selector must hit every **descendant** directly — GTK4 custom properties
    don't inherit reliably and the global `* { --nidara-* }` matches every node directly, so a
    bare `window#nidara-bar { --nidara-* }` only overrides the container. An id-qualified
    universal beats `*` on specificity. It mirrors the `.nd-icon` `-gtk-icon-filter` too.
- **Cairo side:** shell painters read `Theme.chromeIsDark` (not `Theme.isDark`):
  `SquircleContainer` (**`chrome` defaults to `true`** = shell skin; pass `chrome: false` ONLY
  for app-mode windows like About), the dock (`DockAxis`/`DockItem`), the bar CPU/RAM ring +
  battery glyph, and the CC/NC/app-grid Cairo. Non-shell (Settings/About) keep `Theme.isDark`.
  - **Shared Cairo widget drawn into BOTH** (the slider, in CC/system-menu AND Settings) can't
    pick a global flag — it calls **`Theme.surfaceIsDark(widget)`**, which resolves by the
    widget's ROOT window name (`nidara-bar`/`nidara-dock` → `chromeIsDark`, else → `isDark`).
    `common/Slider.ts` uses it for the neutral track colour. Use this for any future shared painter.
- **Light-mode text ramp is nudged up:** `--nidara-text-secondary`/`-dim` are `rgba(fg, 0.85/0.72)`
  in light vs `0.8/0.6` in dark (`nidaraVars`). Black ink over translucent light glass (on an
  arbitrary wallpaper) reads washed-out at the dark-mode alphas; white-on-dark needs less ink.

**Adwaita colour leak (tech-debt #9):** libadwaita is force-loaded in-process and colours
`button` / `calendar` labels by the PROCESS mode — wrong for a pinned shell. Fixed ONCE in
`_reset.scss`: `button, calendar { color: var(--nidara-text); }` (low specificity, high provider
priority → beats Adwaita, loses to our classes). **Don't** patch `color` per menu/button — new
shell text follows the pin automatically.

### Opacity — one master + Advanced, four surfaces, WYSIWYG

There is **no opacity floor** (an old light-mode 0.40 floor was removed — pinning painted opacity
above the slider value is incoherent). Glass opacity is **WYSIWYG with the slider**; legibility is
the user's call (raise it, or pin the shell to dark). Four independent opacities, all plain
"opacity" (higher = more opaque), one range `[0.05, 0.80]`:
- `barOpacity` → bar capsules (Cairo) — `SquircleContainer({ opacityRole: "bar" })`.
- `overlayOpacity` → overlays CC/NC/Prism/app-grid (Cairo) — `opacityRole: "overlay"` (default).
- `dockOpacity` → dock (Cairo, `DockAxis`).
- `windowOpacity` → Settings/About windows = the **CSS token path** (`--nidara-bg`/materials/
  popovers in `nidaraVars`). Those windows are CSS-painted, not Cairo — hence a separate axis.

`Theme.setGlassOpacity()` is the **master** (sets all four); per-surface setters drive "Advanced".
The Settings UI (`pages/Appearance.tsx`) = one "Glass" master slider + a `Gtk.Revealer` "Advanced"
disclosure (Bar/Overlays/Dock/Window). When adding a shell capsule, `SquircleContainer` already
defaults to shell skin — pass `opacityRole: "bar"` if it's a bar capsule (else it tracks overlay).

### Tray icons recolour conditionally (not "never", not "always")

A common misconception (it bit a past explanation): system-tray icons are NOT uniformly
"app pixmaps that can't recolour". `Tray.tsx` resolves each item like this:
- If the app exposes its icon by **name** AND the active icon theme has a **`-symbolic`**
  variant of it → load the symbolic icon; CSS `-gtk-icon-style: symbolic` + `.bar-tray-icon
  { color: var(--nidara-text) }` recolour it, so it **follows the theme and the chrome pin**
  (this is why e.g. Telegram's tray icon flips — its symbolic exists in the icon theme, no
  app-specific code).
- Otherwise → fall back to the app's composited `gicon` **pixmap**, which **can't** recolour.

Consequence: a single bar can show some tray icons themed and others full-colour, depending
purely on what the icon theme provides. That's inherent to SNI (apps supply what they
supply); making it coherent is a policy decision, deferred — see tech-debt #24.

## Accent palette (9 colors)

| Name | Hex |
|---|---|
| blue | `#0088FF` |
| teal | `#2190A4` |
| green | `#79B757` |
| yellow | `#F3BA4B` |
| orange | `#E9873A` |
| red | `#ED5F5D` |
| pink | `#E55E9C` |
| purple | `#9A57A3` |
| slate | `#6F8396` |

## Real blur = compositor, not widget

GTK has no true `backdrop-filter`. CSS only sets the translucent background, sheen, and border. The `backdrop-filter: blur()` you see in SCSS is **web-preview only** and is ignored by AGS at runtime. Real blur comes from Hyprland `layerrule blur, <namespace>`. Don't try to "fix" the absent blur from inside CSS — it's not a CSS problem.

## Glass capsule edge = AA, NOT none (don't flip it back)

`drawSquircle` fills the glass body with **antialias GRAY (AA)** so the capsule
curves are smooth. It was **NONE** (hard 1-bit edge) until 2026-06-24 to dodge a
feared "halo": Hyprland blurs any pixel with alpha > `ignore_alpha` (0.01), so AA
edge pixels (alpha = glass × coverage) show the blurred backdrop and were thought
to glow at the curved ends. **Re-measured** with offline renders + live grim
captures over a real *light* wallpaper through Hyprland's actual blur: the halo is
**negligible** (the soft edge just blends into its surroundings), while NONE's
stair-stepped curves were clearly visible. So AA wins. The border/rim strokes
(steps 2-3) still clip to the path so their inner AA can't spill outward. **Don't
"fix" this back to NONE** thinking AA causes a halo — it was checked on real pixels.

## Cairo vs CSS

- **CSS** for anything with states (hover/active/focus/drag).
- **Cairo** for complex static shapes (squircles, dots with halo, ring charts).
- **Important:** if Cairo paints a node's background, CSS must **not** also declare `background-color`. You'll get double-paint artifacts.
- **Most icon glyphs cannot be CSS-recolored to an arbitrary colour — verify before assuming
  `color:` works on one.** GTK4 only recolours a `Gio.FileIcon` if its filename ends in
  `-symbolic` (see "The bar launcher mark" below) — that's the WHOLE mechanism, filename-gated,
  nothing to do with the SVG's own `fill="currentColor"`. Our general icon set (`core/Icons.ts`,
  Lucide-derived — `wifi.svg`, `check.svg`, etc.) doesn't use that suffix, so `color: var(--nidara-accent)`
  on a `Gtk.Image` showing one of them silently does nothing; the only real lever is `.nd-icon`'s
  `-gtk-icon-filter: invert(1)`, a fixed black/white toggle for dark/light, not a recolor. Found
  this dead on Settings → Power's profile checkmark (`accent-icon`, deleted 2026-07-01) — verify
  empirically (screenshot + crop, don't trust the CSS alone) before relying on `color:` on any of
  these icons. Anything that genuinely needs a live-coloured glyph draws in Cairo instead —
  `buildSelectionCheck` in `Power.tsx` (a 3-point path matching Lucide's "check") is the reference.
  **Don't reach for accent by default, though:** that checkmark sits on a `.nidara-row:selected`
  row, whose background is *already* an accent tint (`--nidara-state-selected`, itself derived
  from the live accent) — an accent-coloured check on an accent-tinted row nearly disappears
  (found live, corrected same day). Cairo-drawing a glyph means picking its colour is now on you;
  default to mode-aware white/black (`Theme.isDark`) like `--nidara-text`, and only reach for
  live accent when the glyph sits on the shell's own neutral glass, not on another accent fill.
- **Any Cairo draw call that needs a colour defined as a hex string elsewhere goes through
  `hexToFloatRgb(hex)`** (`common/DrawingUtils.ts`) — `"#rrggbb"` → `{r,g,b}` as 0..1 floats,
  never a hand-rolled `parseInt(hex.slice(...), 16) / 255` triplet. Before this existed, that
  three-liner was independently copy-pasted into `SquircleContainer` (×2), the CC drag ghost,
  and — worse — `common/Slider.ts` and `widgets/battery.ts` had drifted into hardcoding their
  OWN *pre-computed float copies* of a color instead of parsing the real hex live. Found because
  the slider's fill and battery's low/charging colors turned out to be silently duplicating (and
  in battery's case, duplicating the WRONG source — see below), not just visually similar by
  coincidence. **Two canonical hex sources, both plain string constants, no Gtk/Cairo import:**
  `lib/accent.ts`'s `ACCENT_HEX` (9 user-selectable accent colors — decorative, changes with
  Settings → Appearance) and `lib/status-colors.ts`'s `DANGER_HEX`/`SUCCESS_HEX` (fixed
  "needs attention"/"good" colors — used by the recording indicator, battery critical/charging;
  must NOT move with the user's accent choice, since accent has its own selectable "red"/"green"
  entries that mean something different). `battery.ts`'s old `RED`/`GREEN` were a comment lying
  to itself: it claimed to match the danger/success seeds but the actual float values matched
  `ACCENT_HEX.red`/`.green` instead — battery would have quietly wrestled the user's accent
  palette's arbitrary "red" swatch in a semantic slot for the wrong reason. Corrected to
  `hexToFloatRgb(DANGER_HEX)`/`hexToFloatRgb(SUCCESS_HEX)`. For the *live* accent specifically
  (not a fixed status color), read it off `Theme.accentPalette[Theme.accentColor].color` first,
  same as everywhere else, then pass that hex through `hexToFloatRgb` — don't read `ACCENT_HEX`
  directly for anything that should track live theme state.

## Adwaita vs pure GTK4 — the central rule

This is the table that decides almost every "which widget should I use?" question:

| Surface | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Dock, Bar, workspace dots, resource circles, schematic | **Pure GTK4 + Cairo** (`Gtk.DrawingArea` / `Gtk.Snapshot`) | Adwaita adds nothing here; painting direct = zero defensive CSS. |
| Floating overlays (CC, NotifCenter, Prism/Spotlight, SystemMenu, Overview) | **`Gtk.Box` + gtk4-layer-shell + custom CSS** | Adwaita would only add chrome you'd have to undo. |
| Toggles / switches / buttons inside overlays | **`Gtk.Switch`, `Gtk.Button`** (NOT `Adw.*Row`) | Base widgets style cleanly; `Adw.*Row` brings padding/focus-ring/separators that have to be killed one by one. |
| Sliders (any) | **`makeSlider`** from `common/Slider.ts` (NOT `Gtk.Scale`) | See "Sliders" below — one Cairo component for the whole shell. |
| Settings window | **`ui/lib/nidara-kit`** (`NidaraSplitView`, `NidaraClamp`, `NidaraButton`, `NidaraSelect`) | Custom split view. **Do NOT use `Adw.OverlaySplitView`** — it breaks capsule margins. |
| Modal dialogs | **`showNidaraAlert`** from `nidara-kit` | Clean, themeable. |

**Rule of thumb:** everything is **pure GTK4** — libadwaita has been fully removed. Dark/light is set via `Gtk.Settings.gtk_application_prefer_dark_theme` (no `Adw.init()`); the About window is a plain `Gtk.Window` (no `Adw.AboutWindow`). Don't reintroduce any `Adw.*`.

## Buttons — one component + a variant convention

All action buttons go through **`NidaraButton`** (`ui/lib/nidara-kit/button.ts`) — never
`new Gtk.Button({ css_classes: ["nidara-btn", …] })` by hand, and never per-surface classes
(`settings-row-action` was a dead class that left its button rendering as raw Adwaita). CSS
lives once in `_components.scss` under `button.nidara-btn`.

Variants carry **intent**, applied consistently across pages (Network/Bluetooth were unified
to this in 2026-06):

| Action | `variant` | `pill` | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| Connect / Pair / Apply / the affirmative CTA | `primary` | `true` | label |
| Disconnect / neutral secondary action | `secondary` (default) | `true` | label |
| **Destructive** (Forget network, Remove device) | `danger` | `true` | trash icon |
| Scan / Search / other plain actions | `secondary` | `true` | label |

- **`danger` is for destructive only.** Disconnect is reversible → `secondary`, NOT danger.
- **`ghost`** (transparent, dim text) reads as *text with a hover*, not a button — use it only
  for subtle nav affordances (e.g. a row "details" chevron), never for a real action like Scan.
- For a button whose intent toggles at runtime (e.g. connect⇄disconnect), build it with
  `NidaraButton({ pill: true })` and `add/remove_css_class("nidara-btn--primary")` in your
  state setter (the base `--secondary` class is a no-op, so removing `--primary` = neutral).
- **Icon-only buttons:** pass `icon: true` (adds `nidara-btn--icon` — compact uniform padding)
  and `set_child(new Gtk.Image({ … css_classes: ["nd-icon"] }))`. This keeps an icon button the
  same height as a labelled one in a cluster (e.g. details/forget sitting next to Connect),
  instead of looking smaller/odd. Don't hand-roll icon buttons with ad-hoc sizing.

For an icon that belongs **next to a row's title** rather than as a trailing control (e.g. a
lock on a secured Wi-Fi row), pass it as `NidaraRow`'s `titleIcon` arg (threaded through
`createRow(label, subtitle, widget, titleIcon)`) — don't park it in the trailing control box.
For an icon that **leads the row** (an identity icon before the title, e.g. each widget's icon
in Settings → Widgets, or an app icon), pass `NidaraRow`'s `leadingIcon` arg (also threaded
through `createRow(label, subtitle, widget, titleIcon, leadingIcon)`) — it sits as the row's
first child, before the title column.

## CC capsule tiles: stateful vs action (no fake status line)

The 2×1 (WIDE) CC tile built by `buildCapsuleInner(getIcon, getTitle, getSubTitle)` (in
`surfaces/control-center/Toggles.tsx`) adapts to whether the widget has a **status**:
- **Stateful** (wifi, bluetooth, focus, ethernet, vpn, battery): `getSubTitle()` returns the
  live state ("Connected", "Off", an SSID, "Do not disturb"…) → single-line title + dim
  subtitle.
- **Action / stateless** (screenshot, screen recording, clipboard — they *do* something, they
  aren't *on/off*): `getSubTitle()` returns `""`. The sub line is hidden and the title is
  allowed to **wrap to two lines, vertically centred**, so the name reads in full ("Screen
  Recording") instead of being padded with a redundant descriptor ("Screen Record / Record
  screen"). The shape is **derived from the subtitle being empty**, so a dynamic widget (focus
  *off* → empty sub) gets it for free. When adding a CC widget: return a real state subtitle or
  return `""` — never invent a description-as-subtitle. (`applySub()` runs at build time too, so
  plain detail-opening tiles that never call `update()` still hide the empty line.)

**Wrap the capsule box with `wrapCapsuleTile(inner.box)` (or use the button path
`buildCapsuleContent`) — never a bespoke wrapper.** A WIDE tile is left-anchored by BaseIsland
(`child.halign = START, hexpand = false`), and `wrapCapsuleTile` adds the exact nesting level
that survives `SquircleContainer`'s padding so the icon/text land on the same grid as every
other tile. A tile that built its own wrapper — screen recording once put an idle/recording
`Gtk.Stack` inside a hand-rolled `outer` box — insets the content a few px off from the column
(visible once you line the tiles up). If a tile has multiple visual states (e.g. record ⇄
stop), drive ONE `buildCapsuleInner` via getters + `inner.update()` on a `notify::` (and toggle
state classes on `inner.iconBox`/`inner.icon`/`inner.label`/`inner.subLabel`) — the same
dynamic-capsule pattern as wifi/focus — instead of swapping whole subtrees in a stack.

**A widget that needs BOTH a one-tap toggle AND a `buildCCDetail` subpage uses
`buildSplitCapsuleContent`, not `buildCapsuleContent`.** `buildCapsuleContent` wraps the *entire*
capsule in one `Gtk.Button` — fine for toggle-only widgets (dark_mode, night_light, focus), but it
swallows the tile-level click IslandGrid wires up for `buildCCDetail` widgets, so a toggle widget
that grows a subpage (bluetooth → device list) has no way to open it. `buildSplitCapsuleContent`
makes *only the icon badge* a button (the toggle); the title/subtitle stay plain so the unclaimed
click area falls through to IslandGrid's detail handler — the same mechanism the plain
detail-opening tiles (wifi, ethernet) already rely on, just carved out of a smaller region instead
of the whole tile. CSS gotcha: the icon button's own class (`.cc-split-icon-btn`) must outrank the
blanket `.cc-island button { reset }` — a single-class selector loses that fight on specificity
regardless of source order, so it's written as a two-class descendant
(`.cc-island .cc-split-icon-btn`), which always wins.

**A "stateful" tile's on-state fills the WHOLE capsule with the live accent colour** (macOS/GNOME/
Windows quick-settings convention), not just the icon. Wired via `AtomicWidget.getActive`/
`watchActive` (`Types.ts`) → `BaseIsland` → `SquircleContainer`'s `getActive`/`activeAlpha`/
`watchActive` props: `getActive()` is read live *inside the Cairo draw call*, so it paints through
the exact same `resolveDrawParams`/`drawSquircle` path a real tile already uses — no separate CSS
shape to keep in sync, no mismatched corners. `watchActive(cb)` only exists because the container
can't know the state changed on its own (it's driven by the widget's own domain signal — BT
power, `notifd`'s `dont_disturb`, `Theme` changed, an nmcli poll); it just calls `cb` to trigger
`da.queue_draw()`. Live on **dark_mode, night_light, focus, bt, vpn** — action/stateless widgets
(screenshot, clipboard) have nothing to fill and omit both props. `wifi`/`ethernet` don't have this
either: their WIDE tile has no toggle button at all (see `buildSplitCapsuleContent` above), so
there's no "this tile is a toggle" moment to fill — only their `buildCCDetail` switch reflects
state today. VPN is the template for a **polled** (non-signal) state: one shared module-level
poller + listener `Set` in `vpn.ts` (`watchVpnActive`), lazily started on first subscriber, instead
of a `GLib.timeout_add` per built tile instance — cheaper and it's what let the 1×1 icon and the
capsule badge both go live for free, which they weren't before.

**The CC gauge tiles (volume/brightness's TALL slider) fill fractionally, through the SAME
mechanism — `getFill?: (size) => number` (0..1), not a separately-drawn inner layer.** The
original TALL implementation had `makeVerticalFillTile` paint its own accent fill in a nested
inner `DrawingArea`, inset within `BaseIsland`'s own padding — visually a capsule-inside-a-capsule
(the island's own border, THEN a gap, THEN the slider's own smaller pill with no border of its
own). User called it out: it didn't read as the same "material" as an active toggle's fill.
Fixed by extending `drawSquircle` itself with `fillFrac`/`emptyColor`/`emptyAlpha`: ONE path/clip
paints the empty (top) portion with the base glass and the filled (bottom) portion with accent,
so the border + gloss steps right after wrap BOTH portions as one continuous shape — structurally
identical to how `getActive` fills the whole thing, just clipped to a fraction.
`SquircleContainer`'s `getFill` takes priority over `getActive` when given (`frac >= 1` collapses
to the exact same single-fill path `getActive` uses, `frac === 0` is pure glass, no behaviour
change for anything that only passes `getActive`). `getFill` is **size-aware**
(`(size: WidgetSize) => number`) because a slider widget's OTHER sizes aren't gauges — volume's
SINGLE (1×1 icon) and FULL_WIDTH (its own inline thumbed slider row, unrelated to island fill)
both return `0` there, only `WidgetSize.TALL` returns the real fraction. `makeSlider` grew a
matching `paintFill?: boolean` (default true) so `makeVerticalFillTile` can opt OUT of drawing its
own fill (`paintFill: false`) and become a pure interactive hit-region (drag/scroll/click-to-jump)
over whatever BaseIsland paints — nothing else calls `paintFill:false` today, so every other
slider (bar popovers, Settings pages) is unaffected. Brightness has no change signal, so its
`watchActive` is just a 2s redraw poll (reusing the polling reality `buildVertical`/
`buildHorizontal` already live with) reading the SAME shared `_cachedPct` those keep fresh.

**Multi-cell `centerContent` tiles align their items to the grid-cell centres.** A 2×1 tile
spans two grid cells; its content (e.g. cpu_memory's two metric rings) should sit one grid
**pitch** (`UNIT + GAP`) apart, centred — so each item lands on its cell centre, exactly where a
1×1 widget's icon centres and where a 2×1 tile's leading icon sits (the icon inset ≈ `UNIT/2`).
Spacing the items by their natural gap instead bunches them toward the middle, a few px inside
the icon columns. `cpu_memory` does this with `spacing: (UNIT + GAP) − ring` in a `CenterBox`.
`UNIT`/`GAP` are defined in `control-center/Types.ts` (a leaf) and re-exported by
`CCLayoutManager` — read them from `Types` in a widget; importing `CCLayoutManager` from a widget
pulls in the widget registry and forms a boot-crashing import cycle.

**The CC edit-mode drag ghost previews the dragged tile's real silhouette, not a generic rounded
box.** `BaseIsland.tsx` exports `resolveIslandShape(size, width, height)` — the per-`WidgetSize`
shape/radius decision (SINGLE→circle, WIDE/TALL→perfect capsule, FULL_WIDTH→dock-pill,
SQUARE→squircle) that used to live only inline in `BaseIsland()`. `SquircleContainer.tsx` exports
`resolveDrawParams(shape, radius, n, perfect, w, h)` — the second-stage resolution (CIRCLE/CAPSULE
always collapse to a perfect arc sized to `min(w,h)/2`, ignoring the requested radius) that used to
live only inline in its `draw_func`. `IslandGrid.tsx`'s `makeDropGhost` calls both directly and
paints with `drawSquircle` on a bare `Gtk.DrawingArea` (bypassing `SquircleContainer` itself,
because the ghost's invalid/valid tint must be driven by a mutable flag + `queue_draw()`, not a CSS
class — the fill/border colors are baked into the draw call). The result: drag a 1×1 widget → a
circular ghost; a 2×1 → a perfect capsule; a 2×2 → a squircle — always whatever the *real* tile
would render, because both draw from the same two resolvers BaseIsland itself uses. `drawSquircle`
also grew an optional trailing `dash?: number[]` param (only the ghost passes it) so the border
keeps its dashed "phantom" look without a CSS-only dashed-stroke escape hatch.

## The bar launcher mark — flattened path, no SVG filter

The bar launcher (system-menu) icon is the **Nidara mark**, `assets/nidara/assets/nidara-symbolic.svg`,
loaded as a `Gio.FileIcon`. It adapts to dark/light because (a) the filename ends in `-symbolic`,
so GTK4 recolours it, and (b) `.bar-distro-icon { color: var(--nidara-text) }` drives that colour.
The SVG must use `fill="currentColor"` — **never a hardcoded colour** (commandment #10), or it
goes invisible on the opposite theme.

Non-obvious gotcha (cost a wrong first attempt, verified live): **GTK's symbolic recolour does NOT
render SVG `<filter>`s.** The brand "N" in `nidara-logo.svg` gets its soft round terminals from a
goo/metaball `feGaussianBlur`; loaded as a symbolic icon that filter is dropped, so only the bare
rounded rects render and at 18px their tiny `rx` reads as **square terminals**. So the mark must be
a **single filled path with the metaball outline baked into geometry** (no filter) — that's what
`nidara-symbolic.svg` is (traced from a high-res render of the goo). Don't "simplify" it back to the
filtered SVG. The same `nidara-symbolic.svg` is reused at **72px** in the About window header
(`AboutWindow.tsx`, recoloured via `.about-logo`) — it replaced a `distributor-logo-<os-id>` theme
icon that rendered **broken on a clean machine** (no distro logo in the icon pack); our own mark
always resolves and is mode-aware. `nidara-logo.svg` (the filtered version) is the design **source**
/ for any always-dark surface that doesn't need recolour. (Two SVG hygiene gotchas, both real: a `--`
anywhere in an XML comment — e.g. writing a `var(--token)` name — makes strict librsvg reject the
file even though GTK tolerates it; and `fill="currentColor"` is mandatory, never a hardcoded colour,
commandment #10.) The bar icon is configurable (`barSettings.launcherIcon`: preset key or absolute
path); unknown/stale keys fall back to `DEFAULT_LAUNCHER_ICON`. Arch's logo is deliberately **not
bundled** (trademark — restricted, not under the OS's free licence; we ship our own mark and let users
point `launcherIcon` at any file).

## Sliders — one component

All sliders are **`makeSlider`** (Cairo) in `common/Slider.ts` (`makeHSlider` is just a
horizontal wrapper). There is **no native `Gtk.Scale`** and no `PillSlider` — don't add them.

- **Cairo-drawn**: fill + thumb are painted together so they never visually separate (the
  native `scale` highlight/slider misalignment bug). Accent comes from `PALETTE[Theme.accentColor]`.
- **Custom input** (a `GestureDrag` + scroll + arrow keys, *not* a `Gtk.Scale`): clicking the
  track jumps to that position; grabbing the thumb never warps it; `drag-begin` claims the
  sequence so a slider inside a clickable tile (e.g. a CC widget) doesn't trigger the tile.
  **Gotcha:** that same eager claim-on-press also wins against the CC's edit-mode
  tile-move `DragSource` on `overlay` — GTK4 delivers bubble-phase events to the deepest
  widget under the pointer first, so the slider (a descendant) claims before the ancestor
  `DragSource` ever gets a look, and a slider tile becomes undraggable in edit mode.
  Fixed in `IslandGrid.tsx`'s `makeIslandWidget`: when `editMode`, `content.set_can_target(false)`
  — the same "pointer-transparent" idiom already used for `cc-slot-placeholder`/the drag ghost —
  so `pick()` resolves the press straight to `overlay` and the move-drag always wins. Applies to
  every tile's content, not just sliders: nothing inside a tile should be independently
  actionable while rearranging (only the × remove badge and the drag itself stay live).
- **Options:** `orientation: "horizontal" | "vertical"`, `thumb` (default true). `thumb: false`
  + a wide `trackH` = the macOS-style vertical capsule (fill rises, clipped to the capsule so
  the end follows the rounded cap). Thumb goes translucent while pressed. `paintFill` (default
  true) = false makes this `DrawingArea` paint NOTHING, a pure interactive hit-region — used by
  `makeVerticalFillTile` (see the CC gauge tiles entry above), whose fill now lives one level up
  in `BaseIsland`, not here. Every other caller leaves `paintFill` alone and is unaffected.
- **Wiring:** `onChange` (committed, optional `debounce` / `commitOnRelease`), `onValueChanged`
  (live, for the % label), `onExtChange(cb) → cleanup` for external value updates (ignored
  while the user drags).
- **`makeVerticalFillTile`'s bottom icon is sized/placed to match a 1×1 tile's icon exactly** —
  28px glyph, vertical centre `UNIT/2` (40px) above the TALL tile's true bottom edge, not an
  arbitrary smaller icon of its own. Derivation: `40 − 4 (BaseIsland's TALL padding,
  `islandPadding()`) − 14 (half the 28px glyph) = margin_bottom: 22`. This works because a
  SINGLE tile's icon (button `width_request:48` + CENTER align) always resolves to the dead
  centre of its 80×80 cell regardless of padding magnitude, so `UNIT/2` from either edge is the
  correct target for both. If `UNIT`/`islandPadding`/the glyph size ever change, recompute this
  margin too — it's a hand-derived constant (matching the existing `trackH: 72` comment right
  above it in `common/Slider.ts`), not something that re-derives itself.
- **`makeVerticalFillTile`'s `icon` param accepts a getter** (`Gio.FileIcon | (() =>
  Gio.FileIcon)`) plus an optional `iconSubscribe?: (sync) => cleanup`, so a level-dependent icon
  (volume's mute/low/medium/high ladder, via `AudioSvc.targetVolumeIcon`/`watchVolume`) stays
  live on the TALL tile — the same canonical helper the bar icon and the SINGLE icon already
  used. Pass a plain `Gio.FileIcon` (no subscribe) for a static icon like brightness's `Icons.sun`.

## Tooltips — one component

All shell tooltips go through **`attachTooltip(widget, text, opts?)`** from `common/Tooltip.ts`.
**Don't use GTK's `tooltip_text` / `tooltip_markup` on shell surfaces** — the native tooltip renders
in its own `GtkTooltipWindow`, out of reach of our scoped CSS, so it can never be themed (this is why
the dock "looked like default GTK"). It's a hover-delayed `Gtk.Popover` (`has_arrow: false`); the
bubble — rounded body **plus the pointer** — is painted in **Cairo as ONE continuous shape**: a
single glass fill and a single 1px inner-edge stroke that wraps body and arrow together. **That
bubble painter is shared** — it lives in `common/GlassBubble.ts` (`paintGlassBubble`) and the dock
context menu paints the same shape (see "The glass bubble" below); the tooltip only adds the label.

- **Why Cairo, not a GTK popover arrow:** GTK always strokes the arrow's *base* where it meets the
  body. With an opaque popover the body fill hides that seam; our glass is translucent, so it shows
  through as a line at the junction. There's no CSS way to border only the arrow's slanted sides
  (the triangle is made by clipping, not by per-side borders). Painting the whole silhouette
  ourselves is the only way to get a continuous rim on translucent glass — and it's the Nidara way
  (all custom shapes are Cairo). The popover is still its own surface, so it keeps Hyprland's blur.
- **Lives in `common/`, not `lib/nidara-kit`** — it reads `Theme` (chrome pin + opacity), like the
  other shared Cairo widgets (`SquircleContainer`, `Slider`, `ScaleRevealer`). `nidara-kit` stays
  Theme-free / portable, so a Theme-coupled widget can't live there.
- **Glass:** fill tint follows `Theme.chromeIsDark` (shell skin) and alpha is `Math.max(Theme.overlayOpacity, 0.38)`.
  **The 0.38 floor is load-bearing:** a tooltip is a *popup*, and Hyprland blurs popups with
  `popups_ignorealpha = 0.30` (NOT the bar/dock layer's `ignore_alpha` 0.01/0.04). Track the raw
  overlay slider and at a low setting the bubble drops below 0.30 and **stops blurring** (reads flat).
  This is the same reason `NidaraTheme` floors `--nidara-popover-bg` at `Math.max(bgAlpha, 0.38)` — any
  popup glass must clear the popup threshold. `chrome:false` (About) is a normal window with no blur →
  near-opaque fill. Rim is white on dark glass, a subtle dark line on light. Repaints on `Theme "changed"`.
  Geometry consts (`ARROW_W/H`, `PAD_*`, radius clamp so the arrow base fits the straight edge) are at the top.
- **Text** is `string | (() => string)`. A getter is resolved **lazily, right before show** — so
  live values (a window title) stay fresh WITHOUT subscribing (a subscription forces a dock redraw +
  blur pass per title tick; see `DockItem.computeTitle`).
- **Opts:** `position` (default TOP — the Cairo arrow is painted on the *requested* side, so pick one
  with room or GTK auto-flips and the arrow points the wrong way; a top-bar item passes `BOTTOM`),
  `delay` (500ms), `markup` (Pango — tray uses it), `chrome`, `suppress: () => boolean` (skip while a
  context menu is open — the dock passes `() => menu.visible`).
- **Lifecycle:** self-cleans on the host widget's `destroy` (drops the Theme handler, unparents);
  returns `{ popover, setText, destroy }`.
- **Adopted:** dock (replaced the bespoke `dock-tooltip` popover), bar tray (position BOTTOM), app
  grid, About close (`chrome:false`). `.nidara-tooltip` CSS in `_components.scss` only resets the
  popover chrome to transparent (the bubble is Cairo) + sets the label colour/size.
  **Settings deliberately keeps native GTK tooltips** — an ordinary in-window app surface where the
  native tooltip is expected and reads fine; the one intentional residual, not debt to "fix".

## The glass bubble — `common/GlassBubble.ts` (tooltip + context menus)

The Cairo glass bubble — a rounded capsule with a **pointer spliced into one side as one continuous
silhouette** (single fill, single 1px inner edge wrapping body AND arrow, no seam) — lives in
`common/GlassBubble.ts` and is **shared by the tooltip and BOTH context menus (dock + app-grid)** so
they all speak the same glass language. Don't re-implement it; every consumer paints via `paintGlassBubble`.

- **The pointer is a downward TRIANGLE with ONLY the tip filleted** — a TRUE circular arc tangent to
  both diagonal sides, so the sides stay perfectly straight (no kink, no bowing). **The arc must stay
  SMALL relative to the triangle** (`TIP_R` ≪ side length): a big arc eats the straight sides and the
  whole thing reads as a *bell*, not a triangle — that's the failure mode to avoid. The `arrowTip`
  helper caps the fillet so it can't reach the base, and `paintGlassBubble` **clamps the base width**
  to the edge's straight portion so a short bubble's arrow never overruns its corners.
- **ONE size for tooltip AND menu** (consts `ARROW_W`/`ARROW_H`/`TIP_R`). Keep `ARROW_H` modest — a
  tall pointer separates the body too far from its anchor (and on the menu looks detached). Both
  surfaces reserve `ARROW_H` in their content margins (`Tooltip.ts` label margins, `DockItem.tsx`
  `menuRows` margins). Don't reintroduce per-surface arrow sizes — they were tried and looked
  inconsistent.

- **`paintGlassBubble(cr, w, h, side, { chrome?, radiusMax? })`** — fills the bubble + strokes the
  inner rim. `chrome` (default true) = shell skin (`Theme.chromeIsDark`) vs app-mode; `radiusMax`
  (default 13) caps the corner radius (tooltip 13, the roomier menu passes 16). **Alpha is floored at
  0.38 inside the painter** — a popover is a *popup*, blurred by Hyprland's `popups_ignorealpha`
  (0.30), NOT the dock/bar layer's `ignore_alpha`; below 0.38 it stops blurring and reads flat (the
  same load-bearing floor as `--nidara-popover-bg`). The dock/bar layerrules carry `blur_popups = true`,
  so the popover blurs on its own surface.
- **`sideFor(position)`** maps a `Gtk.PositionType` to the side the pointer is painted on (it points
  *back* at the anchor: a popover ABOVE the item → arrow on its bottom). The content child clears the
  arrow strip + AA buffer with margins computed inline from the exported `BUF`/`ARROW_H` consts
  (`BUF + PAD + (side === thatSide ? ARROW_H : 0)` per edge — see `layoutMenu` in `AppGrid.tsx`).
- **Structure** (both tooltip and menu): a `Gtk.Grid` overlaying a `Gtk.DrawingArea` (paints the
  bubble, `halign/valign FILL`) and the content (label / rows box) with the arrow-aware margins.
  Repaint on `Theme "changed"`; disconnect that handler on `destroy` (the menu is rebuilt per dock
  layout change, so a leaked handler accumulates).

### Context menus — glass popover, NOT `Gtk.PopoverMenu`

A right-click context menu on a shell surface must be a **plain `Gtk.Popover`** whose body is the
glass bubble above, **never `Gtk.PopoverMenu`**. `PopoverMenu` renders GTK's native `modelbutton`
chrome, which (like the native tooltip) can't be themed to glass — exactly why "the dock menu looked
like default GTK". Two consumers today, same pattern (see `surfaces/dock/DockItem.tsx`
`ensurePopover`/`updateMenuModel`, and `surfaces/app-grid/AppGrid.tsx` `ensureMenu`/`updateMenu`):

- **`new Gtk.Popover({ autohide: true, has_arrow: false, css_classes: ["nidara-menu-popover"] })`** —
  autohide so it grabs focus and dismisses on outside click; no GTK arrow (we paint our own pointer,
  aimed back at the item, via `paintGlassBubble`).
- **Rows = `renderMenuModel(model, actionGroup, onClose)`** from `common/NidaraMenu.ts` — the SAME
  component as the bar tray menu, so every menu is identical glass rows (`.nidara-menu-row`,
  separators, dim section/submenu headers — section labels render as headers too). It activates
  actions on the passed group directly. The bubble DrawingArea + rows box are built ONCE (stable host,
  rows rebuilt per show) so the Theme subscription isn't leaked per show.
- **CSS** is the shared **`.nidara-menu-popover`** (`_components.scss`) — it only resets the popover
  chrome to transparent (`@include nidara-reset` on root + `> contents`), exactly like
  `.nidara-tooltip`; the glass is all Cairo. (The old per-surface `.dock-menu` rule is gone.)
- **Open direction:** the dock is edge-anchored, so its menu always opens inward (fixed `position`).
  The app-grid item can sit anywhere, so its handler **picks the direction per right-click** — flips
  the menu up for items low in the launcher (`compute_bounds` vs root height, 0.65 threshold), then
  sets `menuSide = sideFor(position)` and repaints, so the fixed Cairo arrow stays aimed at the item
  (GTK's own auto-flip would desync a painted arrow). **No native `Gtk.PopoverMenu` remains in the shell.**

## Show/hide animations — `ScaleRevealer` (THE overlay animation)

CSS `transform: scale` is banned on interactive widgets (see anti-pattern 6 below), but a
**snapshot-time** scale is fine: **`ScaleRevealer`** (`common/ScaleRevealer.ts`) shows/hides
its child with a grow/shrink + fade. It scales in `vfunc_snapshot` (paint only, ends at
identity — hit-testing is correct at rest). API: `reveal(open, onDone?)`; the wrapper
manages its own visibility (hides itself when the close finishes, *then* fires `onDone` —
that's where the bar refreshes the layer-shell input region). There is **no CSS overlay
fade anymore** (`.overlay-fade`/`common/fade.ts` were removed); every animated surface
goes through this one component. Two modes:

- **`animateLayout: true`** (default — notification banners): the *measured height* follows
  the scale, so siblings reflow like a `Gtk.Revealer SLIDE_DOWN`. `scaleFrom` is dramatic
  (0.25) and the pivot top-right: banners sprout from under the bar's clock capsule.
- **`animateLayout: false`** (spread as the **`OVERLAY_POP`** preset: CC, NC, Prism, system
  menu, overview, app grid, bar expansion panel): Gtk.Bin semantics — measure/allocation
  pass through 1:1, so external `halign`/margins/`height_request` on the wrapper behave
  exactly as on the child (in `Bar.tsx` the wrapper IS the `cc`/`nc`/... variable), and each
  frame only repaints. Subtle macOS pop: 0.97→1, in 220ms, out 150ms. Pivot per surface,
  toward its visual anchor (cc/nc `top-right`, system menu `top-left`, expansion panel
  `top-center`, centered surfaces `center`).

**Asymmetric easing, on purpose:** ease-OUT opening, ease-IN closing. A decelerating exit
leaves a long low-opacity tail where only high-contrast content (icons, images, 1px Cairo
borders) stays perceptible — that tail is what made the old CSS fade look "non-uniform"
("icons disappear later"). Related compositor knob: the `nidara-bar` layer rule runs
`ignore_alpha = 0.01` (hyprland.lua) so the backdrop blur doesn't pop off mid-close — at
0.05 the glass crossed the threshold while still clearly visible.

- **Teardown:** call `dismantle()` right after removing it from its parent. It deliberately
  has no `vfunc_dispose` override — GJS blocks JS vfuncs during garbage collection, so a
  dispose override never runs on GC finalization and the child leaks ("still has children
  left" warnings). Long-lived wrappers (the overlays) never need it; per-notification
  banners do.
- **Typing gotcha:** the class merges `export interface ScaleRevealer extends Gtk.Widget`
  because the ambient `ags/gtk4` typing exposes `Gtk` as `any` in value position — without
  the merge, tsc can't see the inheritance. Don't add TS `private` members or members whose
  name collides with a `Gtk.Widget` property (e.g. `scaleFactor`) — both break the merge.
- **Banner sizing:** the popup column uses `GRID_WIDTH` (356px, from `CCLayoutManager`) so
  banners match the NC cards exactly — one `NotificationCapsule`, one size. Wrapping labels
  inside layer-shell windows need `max_width_chars`: a wrapping `Gtk.Label` requests the
  full *unwrapped* text width as its natural width, and a layer window sizes to natural
  (the NC's scroll clamps it, a popup window balloons).

## SCSS conventions and anti-patterns

These are the patterns that bite. Most "the styles look wrong" bugs in this codebase are violations of one of these.

1. **Avoid `background: none; border: none; box-shadow: none` chains** on internal nodes (`decoration`, `contents`, `ripple`, `focus-ring`, `outline`, viewport, list). If you find yourself needing ≥3 of these resets, the widget is probably Adwaita and should be a GTK base widget instead. Use `@mixin nidara-reset` for the canonical reset.
2. **Avoid long specificity chains** like `window.x preferencespage preferencesgroup list.boxed-list row`. They're a strong signal you're fighting Adwaita and should switch to base GTK + a flat custom class.
   - The fix: add `add_css_class("nidara-foo")` in TSX and style a flat `.nidara-foo`.
3. **Avoid color literals.** Resolve against tokens (`--nidara-danger`, etc.). The legitimate exceptions are the accent swatches and the danger/success/warning seeds inside `NidaraTheme.ts`.
4. **Use `@mixin glass($level)`** (surface / raised / floating) instead of repeating ~20 glass blocks. *Currently underused — only 2 call sites; migrating the rest is open work (see `tech-debt.md`).*
5. **`background-clip: padding-box` + `border: Npx solid transparent`** for "visual thickness ≠ real thickness" (avoids negative margins that break `GtkGizmo`).
6. **No `transform: scale` or `transform: translate` on interactive widgets.** GTK respects them but they break hit-testing. Use `margin`, scale inside Cairo, or — for transient show/hide animations — a snapshot-time transform that ends at identity (see `ScaleRevealer` above). *(CSS transforms currently clean: 0 occurrences. Don't reintroduce them.)*
7. **All component CSS wrapped in `window#name { … }`** — never global unscoped.

## When you're tempted to invent a new pattern

Before adding a new mixin, new token, or new class convention: check whether `_base.scss` already has it, and whether `@mixin glass` / `@mixin nidara-reset` cover the case. Migrating to existing mixins is a stated direction of the project (`@mixin glass` underuse is item #5 in the tech-debt list); adding a parallel pattern makes the future migration worse.
