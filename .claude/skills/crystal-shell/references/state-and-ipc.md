# Crystal Shell — State machine & IPC

Read this when adding a new overlay, wiring a new keybind to a UI action, debugging "overlay won't close", or touching anything that previously used `globalThis`.

## The contract: `core/Status.ts`

All overlay visibility flows through one central GObject. **Widgets never flip each other directly.** A widget that wants to know whether the Control Center is open subscribes to `notify::cc-open` on `status` and reacts to that signal.

### Mutually exclusive overlays

Setting any of these to `true` closes all the rest:

- `cc_open`
- `nc_open`
- `prism_open`
- `system_menu_open`
- `overview_open`

This mutual exclusion is **enforced manually inside each setter** — every setter explicitly closes the others. This is a known duplication smell (~80 lines repeated across setters; see `tech-debt.md` item 4) but until it's refactored into a `closeOthersExcept()` helper, you must preserve the pattern when adding a new exclusive overlay.

### Other tracked props

- `about_open` — opened via `status.about_open`, not via a `toggleAbout` because `AboutWindow` is create+destroy, not hide.
- `settings_open` — Settings hides on close instead.
- `recording`
- `cc_edit_mode`
- `bar_expanded_id` — which Bar pill is currently expanded.
- `cc_detail_id` — which CC detail panel is active.

### Toggles

`Status.ts` exposes typed togglers: `toggleCC`, `toggleNC`, `togglePrism`, `toggleSystemMenu`, `toggleOverview`, `toggleAbout`. There's also a convenience getter `isAnyOverlayOpen`.

### Example flow — opening the CC

```
user clicks bar pill
  → ShellActions.toggleCC()
    → status.toggleCC()
      → cc_open = true
        → notify::cc-open fires
          → Bar.tsx (subscribed) shows CC inside the Bar window
          → updates the layer-shell input region
```

This is the canonical pattern: **events go up through actions, state changes propagate down through `notify::` signals.**

## IPC contract: `ags request`

`ags request '<cmd>'` works out of the box because `app.ts` implements `requestHandler(argv, res)`. Hyprland keybinds call `hl.dsp.exec_cmd("ags request <cmd>")`.

### The IPC surface is self-describing

The commands live in a **declarative table** (`IPC_COMMANDS` in `app.ts`) — name, description,
optional aliases, handler. `requestHandler` is a thin lookup over it; there is no switch.
Two built-in commands make the surface introspectable, so scripts and agents never need to
read source to discover it:

- `ags request listActions` → JSON describing every command (name, desc, aliases).
- `ags request dumpState` → JSON snapshot of live shell state: version, locale, dark mode,
  monitor count, which overlays are open, edit/recording flags. Read state → act → re-read
  to verify: that's the intended agent loop. (`crystal-shell-doctor` embeds this output in
  its diagnostic report.)

Current commands (run `listActions` for the live list): `toggleCC|toggleControlCenter`,
`toggleNC|toggleNotificationCenter`, `togglePrism|toggleSpotlight`, `toggleAppGrid`,
`toggleSettings`, `settingsPage <pageId>`, `toggleOverview`, `toggleGameOverlay`,
`hideForLock`, `showAfterLock`, `describeConfig`, `getConfig [key]`, `setConfig <key> <value>`,
`screenshot [path]`, `listActions`, `dumpState`. Aliases are intentional — Hyprland keybinds
were renamed at one point and old names are kept for compatibility.

`screenshot [path]` captures the focused monitor with grim and returns the PNG path
(default `/tmp/crystal-shell-shot-<ts>.png`) — the visual-verification leg of the agent
loop: open a surface (`toggleCC`, `settingsPage X`), wait ~1.5 s, `screenshot`, read the
image. Gated by Settings → AI (`allowScreenshot`), separately from config writes —
capturing the screen is privacy-sensitive. `dumpState` also reports the **effective**
Hyprland config (gaps/rounding/border via `getoption` — includes `hyprland-user.lua`
overrides) and the AI-governance flags.

Commands receive arguments: `requestHandler` passes `argv.slice(1)` to the handler
(`run(args)`). `ags request settingsPage bluetooth` opens the Settings window directly on
that page (sidebar category ids; returns `unknown page: <id>` for bad ids) — the agent-
friendly way to reach a Settings page without synthesizing clicks.

### The agent config surface: `describeConfig` / `getConfig` / `setConfig`

Settings are exposed to agents through a typed registry (`core/ConfigRegistry.ts`; entries
registered in `config-entries.ts`):

- `ags request describeConfig` → JSON schema of every exposed setting: description, type,
  enum values / min/max, writability, current value. **Read this first** — never guess keys.
- `ags request getConfig dock.iconSize` (one key) / `ags request getConfig` (all values).
- `ags request setConfig appearance.accent blue` → validates against the declared
  type/constraints, applies through the owning service (persists + notifies the UI exactly
  like Settings would), and echoes `{key, value}` back. Invalid input returns a
  self-explanatory error, not a crash.

Rules:
- Writes are **gated by Settings → AI** (`AgentConfig.allowConfigWrite`, `ai.json`). When
  disabled, `setConfig` refuses with a pointer to the page. Reads are never gated.
- `ai.*` keys are visible but **not writable via setConfig** — the gate must not be
  flippable through the door it controls.
- **Adding a setting:** register it in `config-entries.ts` (NOT in core/ — dock settings
  import widget state) with a real `desc` (that string is the agent-facing documentation)
  and delegate `set` to the owning service's setter. That's ALL it takes to appear in
  `describeConfig`.

### The MCP server: `crystal-shell-mcp`

The whole surface above is also served over MCP by `bin/crystal-shell-mcp` (installed to
`/usr/bin`), a standalone GJS script — same no-Node pattern as `crystal-portal` — speaking
MCP over stdio. Two discovery paths, dev and user:
- The repo's `.mcp.json` registers it for any agent working in this checkout.
- `install.sh` always (re)writes `~/.config/crystal-shell/.mcp.json` — the one
  installer-managed file in the config dir — pointing at the PATH binary. An agent opened
  inside the config dir auto-discovers it; any other agent can be told to "register the MCP
  server described in `~/.config/crystal-shell/.mcp.json`" (content:
  `{"mcpServers": {"crystal-shell": {"command": "crystal-shell-mcp"}}}`). The Settings → AI
  page shows this path to the user ("Connect Your Agent" row).

It is a **thin adapter with no logic of its own**: every tool shells out to `ags request`
(or `crystal-shell-doctor`), so the `IPC_COMMANDS` table stays the single source of truth —
a new IPC command is reachable through the `run_action` tool with zero MCP changes. Tools:
`list_actions`, `run_action(name, args)`, `dump_state`, `describe_config`, `get_config`,
`set_config`, `screenshot` (returns the PNG **inline as MCP image content** — the client
sees it without a separate read), `doctor`.

Governance: `ai.json.allowMcp` (Settings → AI → "Enable MCP Server") is re-read on **every**
tool call, so the toggle applies live with no restarts; when off, every tool refuses with a
pointer to the page. The finer gates (`allowConfigWrite`, `allowScreenshot`) are enforced
downstream by the shell itself — never duplicate them in the MCP layer. Like the rest of
`ai.*`, `allowMcp` is visible via `describeConfig` but not writable via `setConfig`.

### Adding a new IPC command

1. Add the action to the typed `core/ShellActions` registry.
2. Wire it inside `app.ts main()` (where the registry is populated).
3. Add an entry to the `IPC_COMMANDS` table in `app.ts` — **with a real description**; that
   string is the command's documentation (it's what `listActions` serves). Never grow a
   parallel switch or a second command list elsewhere.
4. Use it from `hyprland.lua` as `hl.dsp.exec_cmd("ags request <yourCmd>")`.

## `ShellActions` replaces `globalThis`

Widget code uses the typed `core/ShellActions` registry. **Do not reintroduce `globalThis` coupling** — there used to be a pattern of stashing functions on the global object, and it's been intentionally removed. If you find yourself reaching for `globalThis` to break a dependency, the fix is almost always to add a typed entry to `ShellActions` and populate it from `app.ts main()`.

## `hideForLock` / `showAfterLock`

The lockscreen needs the shell out of the way while it's active. These two IPC commands hide all shell windows and restore them afterwards. Keep them symmetric — every code path that calls `hideForLock` must have a corresponding `showAfterLock` on the other side, or the shell becomes invisible after an aborted lock.

## Overlay placement: inside the Bar window

This is commandment #5 in `SKILL.md` but it's worth restating here because it's load-bearing for the whole state model:

Overlays (CC, NC, Prism, SystemMenu, Overview) **live as children of the Bar's window** via `Gtk.Overlay`. They are NOT separate `gtk4-layer-shell` windows. Reasons:

- Avoids Hyprland layer-rule conflicts (one Bar layer is easier to reason about than five).
- Lets show/hide animations be GTK-side via `common/ScaleRevealer.ts` (grow+fade) instead of fighting compositor animations.
- Simplifies input region management (one window's mask, not five).

If you find yourself making a new overlay its own window, stop and ask why. The few exceptions (Settings, About) are full top-level windows for separate reasons and don't follow the overlay state machine.
